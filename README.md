# What is it? || Description

This tool validates BPMN models against the offically provided XSDs of the OMG and 
a subset of the descriptive extended constraints from [Geiger (2013)](http://www.uni-bamberg.de/fileadmin/uni/fakultaeten/wiai_lehrstuehle/praktische_informatik/Dateien/Publikationen/techrep-bpmn-serialization-constraints.pdf).

Additionally, the tool checks the schema validity of all in a BPMN file imported WSDL and XML files.
Namely, the following constraints of Geiger identified by their ids can be checked through this tool:

1, 2, 6-9, 21-23, 25, 26, 28, 31, 36, 56, 76, 79, 84, 88, 95-109, 135, 146, 150, 151, 152 

# Requirements and Installation

First, at least Java 7 is required to use the program.

Next, `JAVA_HOME` must be set, included into your `PATH` and point to your JAVA installation for the console usage.

Lastly, this tool supports Gradle usage.
  
# Validation

You can use the validator in two ways, either stand-alone or as API.

## Via Console

The stand-alone validator must be used via console. It prints debug loggings
if `--debug` is added to the JAR invoking. Additionally, the validator needs a number of files, which
should be validated. Their paths have to be added as parameters to the JAR call and
must be separated by a whitespace, so that the validation works correctly. The results
of every file validation is saved as `validation_result_name_of_the_validated_file.xml` in the
folder of the validated file.

An example of the console call is the following: `java -jar bpmnvalidator.jar my_bpmn_file.bpmn`
The path to the file(s) can be either relative to the path of the `bpmnvalidator.jar` or absolute.

## Via JAR

Alternatively, you can include the validator into your project and use it as API. The JAR can be easily created by `gradle build` or `gradle jar` and is then located in `\build\libs`. Next, you have
to get a reference to the validator instance through `BpmnValidatorFactory.getValidatorInstance()`
and then you can call on this object the methods shown below:

``` java
/**
 * Interface for the implementation of the validator. Allows the usage of the
 * validator in other projects. The loglevel is set default to info. If you need
 * another log level, change the log level before the validation process.
 *
 * @author Philipp Neugebauer
 * @version 1.0
 *
 */
public interface BpmnValidator {

	/**
	 * returns the set loglevel of all loggers
	 *
	 * @return the set log level {@link ch.qos.logback.classic.Level}
	 */
	Level getLogLevel();

	/**
	 * Sets the loglevel of all loggers of the bpmn validator to the given level
	 *
	 * @param logLevel
	 *            possible levels: {@link ch.qos.logback.classic.Level}
	 */
	void setLogLevel(Level logLevel);

	/**
	 * checks the given xmlFile for bpmn constraint violations
	 *
	 * @param xmlFile
	 *            the xml file to validate
	 * @return ValidationResult including all checked files and found violations
	 * @throws BpmnValidationException
	 *             if something fails during validation process
	 */
	ValidationResult validate(File xmlFile) throws BpmnValidationException;

	/**
	 * checks the given xmlFiles for bpmn constraint violations
	 *
	 * @param xmlFiles
	 *            the list of xml files to validate
	 * @return list of {@link de.uniba.dsg.bpmn.ValidationResult} including all
	 *         checked files and found violations for each file
	 * @throws BpmnValidationException
	 *             if something fails during validation process
	 */
	List<ValidationResult> validateFiles(List<File> xmlFiles)
			throws BpmnValidationException;

}
```

Therefore, code including this tool will look like the following:

``` java
BpmnValidator v = BpmnValidatorFactory.getValidatorInstance();
v.setLogLevel(Level.INFO);
try {
	v.validate(new File("FilePath"));
	//or
	v.validateFiles(new ArrayList<File>());
} catch (BpmnValidationException e) {
	// handle
}
```

# Documentation

The documentation of the tool can be easily created by executing `gradle javadoc` and is then located in `\build\docs\javadoc`.

# Structure of Software/Repository

The repository is structured in the following way:

	|- gradle: contains the gradle wapper
	|- lib: all libs required for the tool which aren't uploaded to maven central
	|- src
	|-- main
	|--- java: contains all java classes
	|---- de.uniba.dsg.ppn.ba: contains the main class for API usage
	|----- api: contains the factory class
	|----- preprocessing: contains the classes performing the preprocessing step
	|----- validation: contains the classes performing the validation steps
	|--- resources: contains all schema validation files
	|-- test
	|--- java: contains all test classes named by their test case
	|--- resources: contains all test files sorted in folders by their test case

# Developing Helpers

There are different helper classes to debug and simplify developing:

`PrintHelper.java`: prints the results in a nice way

`TestMain.java`: allows the simplified testing and presentation of validation results

``` java
import java.io.File;

import de.uniba.dsg.bpmn.ValidationResult;
import de.uniba.dsg.bpmnspector.schematron.helper.PrintHelper;
import de.uniba.dsg.bpmnspector.schematron.SchematronBPMNValidator;

public class TestMain {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		File f = new File(TestHelper.getTestFilePath() + "002" + File.separator + 
			"success_import.bpmn");
		SchematronBPMNValidator validator = new SchematronBPMNValidator();
		ValidationResult result = validator.validate(f);
		System.out.println("Is File " + f.getName() + " valid? "+ result.isValid());

		if (!result.isValid()) {
			PrintHelper.printViolations(result.getViolations());
		}

	}
}
```
